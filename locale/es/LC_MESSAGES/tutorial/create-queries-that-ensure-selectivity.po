"Selectivity is the ability of a query to narrow results using the index. "
"Effective indexes are more selective and allow MongoDB to use the index for "
"a larger portion of the work associated with fulfilling the query."

"To ensure selectivity, write queries that limit the number of possible "
"documents with the indexed field. Write queries that are appropriately "
"selective relative to your indexed data."

"Suppose you have a field called ``status`` where the possible values are "
"``new`` and ``processed``. If you add an index on ``status`` you've created "
"a low-selectivity index. The index will be of little help in locating "
"records."

"A better strategy, depending on your queries, would be to create a "
":ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` that includes the low-"
"selectivity field and another field. For example, you could create a "
"compound index on ``status`` and ``created_at.``"
