"In a :term:`sharded cluster`, the balancer process is responsible for "
"distributing sharded data around the cluster, so that each :term:`shard` has"

"However, when creating backups from a sharded cluster it is important that "
"you disable the balancer while taking backups to ensure that no chunk "
"migrations affect the content of the backup captured by the backup "
"procedure. Using the procedure outlined in the section :ref:`sharding-"
"balancing-disable-temporarily` you can manually stop the balancer process "
"temporarily. As an alternative you can use this procedure to define a "
"balancing window so that the balancer is always disabled during your "
"automated backup operation."

"This operation configures the balancer to run between 6:00am and 11:00pm, "
"server time. Schedule your backup operation to run *and complete* outside of"

"balancer is running *and* that the balancer can effectively balance the "
"collection among the shards in the window allotted to each."
