"Instead of storing a file in a single document, GridFS divides a file into "
"parts, or chunks, [#chunk-disambiguation]_ and stores each of those chunks "
"as a separate document. By default GridFS limits chunk size to 255k. GridFS "
"uses two collections to store files. One collection stores the file chunks, "
"and the other stores file metadata."

"When you query a GridFS store for a file, the driver or client will "
"reassemble the chunks as needed. You can perform range queries on files "
"stored through GridFS.  You also can access information from arbitrary "
"sections of files, which allows you to \"skip\" into the middle of a video "
"or audio file."
