"In general, the performance gains that indexes provide for *read operations*"

"If an update operation causes a document to exceed the currently allocated "
":term:`record size`, MongoDB relocates the document on disk with enough "
"contiguous space to hold the document. These relocations take longer than "
"in-place updates, particularly if the collection has indexes. If a "
"collection has indexes, MongoDB must update all index entries. Thus, for a "
"collection with many indexes, the move will impact the write throughput."
