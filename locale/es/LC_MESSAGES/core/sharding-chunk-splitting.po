"As chunks grow beyond the :ref:`specified chunk size <sharding-chunk-size>` "
"a :program:`mongos` instance will attempt to split the chunk in half. Splits"
" may lead to an uneven distribution of the chunks for a collection across "
"the shards. In such cases, the :program:`mongos` instances will initiate a "
"round of migrations to redistribute chunks across shards. See :doc:`/core"
"/sharding-balancing` for more details on balancing chunks across shards."
