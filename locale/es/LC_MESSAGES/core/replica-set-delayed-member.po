"Delayed members contain copies of a :term:`replica set's <replica set>` data"
" set. However, a delayed member's data set reflects an earlier, or delayed, "
"state of the set. For example, if the current time is 09:52 and a member has"
" a delay of an hour, the delayed member has no operation more recent than "
"08:52."
