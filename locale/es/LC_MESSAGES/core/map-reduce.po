"Map-reduce is a data processing paradigm for condensing large volumes of "
"data into useful *aggregated* results. For map-reduce operations, MongoDB "
"provides the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` database command."

"In this map-reduce operation, MongoDB applies the *map* phase to each input "
"document (i.e. the documents in the collection that match the query "
"condition). The map function emits key-value pairs. For those keys that have"
" multiple values, MongoDB applies the *reduce* phase, which collects and "
"condenses the aggregated data. MongoDB then stores the results in a "
"collection. Optionally, the output of the reduce function may pass through a"
" *finalize* function to further condense or process the results of the "
"aggregation."

"All map-reduce functions in MongoDB are JavaScript and run within the "
":program:`mongod` process. Map-reduce operations take the documents of a "
"single :term:`collection` as the *input* and can perform any arbitrary "
"sorting and limiting before beginning the map stage. :dbcommand:`mapReduce` "
"can return the results of a map-reduce operation as a document, or may write"
" the results to collections. The input and the output collections may be "
"sharded."

"In MongoDB, map-reduce operations use custom JavaScript functions to *map*, "
"or associate, values to a key. If a key has multiple values mapped to it, "

"The use of custom JavaScript functions provide flexibility to map-reduce "
"operations. For instance, when processing a document, the map function can "
"create more than one key and value mapping or no mapping. Map-reduce "
"operations can also use a custom JavaScript function to make final "
"modifications to the results at the end of the map and reduce operation, "
"such as perform additional calculations."

"In MongoDB, the map-reduce operation can write results to a collection or "
"return the results inline. If you write map-reduce output to a collection, "
"you can perform subsequent map-reduce operations on the same input "
"collection that merge replace, merge, or reduce new results with previous "
"results. See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` and :doc:`/tutorial/perform-incremental-"
"map-reduce` for details and examples."
