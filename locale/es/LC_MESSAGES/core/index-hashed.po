"field. The hashing function collapses sub-documents and computes the hash "

"You may not create compound indexes that have ``hashed`` index fields or "
"specify a unique constraint on a ``hashed`` index; however, you can create "
"both a ``hashed`` index and an ascending/descending (i.e. non-hashed) index "

"MongoDB ``hashed`` indexes truncate floating point numbers to 64-bit "
"integers before hashing. For example, a ``hashed`` index would store the "
"same value for a field that held a value of ``2.3``, ``2.2``, and ``2.9``. "
"To prevent collisions, do not use a ``hashed`` index for floating point "
"numbers that cannot be reliably converted to 64-bit integers (and then back "
"to floating point). MongoDB ``hashed`` indexes do not support floating point"
" values larger than 2\\ :sup:`53`."
