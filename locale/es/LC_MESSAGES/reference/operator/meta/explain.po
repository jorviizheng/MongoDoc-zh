"The :operator:`$explain` operator provides information on the query plan. It"
" returns a document that describes the process and indexes used to return "
"the query. This may provide useful insight when attempting to optimize a "
"query. For details on the output, see "

":operator:`$explain` runs the actual query to determine the result. Although"
" there are some differences between running the query with "
":operator:`$explain` and running without, generally, the performance will be"
" similar between the two. So, if the query is slow, the :operator:`$explain`"
" operation is also slow."

"Additionally, the :operator:`$explain` operation reevaluates a set of "

" perform differently than a normal query. As a result, these operations "
"generally provide an accurate account of *how* MongoDB would perform the "
"query, but do not reflect the length of these queries."
