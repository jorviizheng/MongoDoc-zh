"The :query:`$geoWithin` operator is a geospatial query operator that queries"
" for a defined point, line or shape that exists entirely within another "
"defined shape. When determining inclusion, MongoDB considers the border of a"
" shape to be part of the shape, subject to the precision of floating point "
"numbers."
