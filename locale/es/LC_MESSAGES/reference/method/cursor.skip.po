"The :method:`cursor.skip()` method is often expensive because it requires "
"the server to walk from the beginning of the collection or index to get the "
"offset or skip position before beginning to return result. As offset (e.g. "
"``pageNumber`` above) increases, :method:`cursor.skip()` will become slower "
"and more CPU intensive. With larger collections, :method:`cursor.skip()` may"
" become IO bound."

"Consider using range-based pagination for these kinds of tasks. That is, "
"query for a range of objects, using logic within the application to "
"determine the pagination rather than the database itself. This approach "
"features better index utilization, if you do not need to easily jump to a "
"specific page."
