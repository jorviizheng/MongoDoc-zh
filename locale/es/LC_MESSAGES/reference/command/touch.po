"The :dbcommand:`touch` command loads data from the data storage layer into "
"memory. :dbcommand:`touch` can load the data (i.e. documents) indexes or "
"both documents and indexes. Use this command to ensure that a collection, "
"and/or its indexes, are in memory before another operation. By loading the "
"collection or indexes into memory, :program:`mongod` will ideally be able to"
" perform subsequent operations more efficiently. The :dbcommand:`touch` "
"command has the following prototypical form:"

"By default, ``data`` and ``index`` are false, and :dbcommand:`touch` will "

"If you run :dbcommand:`touch` on a secondary, the secondary will enter a "
"``RECOVERING`` state to prevent clients from sending read operations during "

":data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.state` for more information on replica set "
