"From the perspective of a client application, whether a MongoDB instance is "

"To override the default write concern, specify a write concern with each "

"that specifies that the method return only after the write propagates to the"

"You can include a timeout threshold for a write concern. This prevents write"
" operations from blocking indefinitely if the write concern is unachievable."
" For example, if the write concern requires acknowledgement from 4 members "
"of the replica set and the replica set has only available 3 members, the "
"operation blocks until those members become available. See :ref:`wc-"
"wtimeout`."
