"A *priority 0* member is a secondary that **cannot** become :term:`primary`."
" *Priority 0* members cannot *trigger* :term:`elections <election>`.  "
"Otherwise these members function as normal secondaries. A *priority 0* "
"member maintains a copy of the data set, accepts read operations, and votes "
"in elections. Configure a *priority 0* member to prevent :term:`secondaries "
"<secondary>` from becoming primary, which is particularly useful in multi-"
"data center deployments."

msgid ""
"A *priority 0* member can function as a standby. In some replica sets, it "
"might not be possible to add a new member in a reasonable amount of time. A "
"standby member keeps a current copy of the data to be able to replace an "
"unavailable member."

"In many cases, you need not set standby to *priority 0*. However, in sets "
"with varied hardware or :ref:`geographic distribution <replica-set-"
"geographical-distribution>`, a *priority 0* standby ensures that only "
"qualified members become primary."

"A *priority 0* standby may also be valuable for some members of a set with "
"different hardware or workload profiles. In these cases, deploy a member "
"with *priority 0* so it can't become primary. Also consider using an "
":ref:`hidden member <replica-set-hidden-members>` for this purpose."
