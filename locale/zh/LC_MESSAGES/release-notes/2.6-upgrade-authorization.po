"MongoDB 2.6 includes significant changes to the authorization model, which "
"requires changes to the way that MongoDB stores users' credentials. As a "
"result, in addition to upgrading MongoDB processes, if your deployment uses "
"authentication and authorization, after upgrading all MongoDB process to 2.6"
" you **must** also upgrade the authorization model."

"Before upgrading the authorization model, you should first upgrade MongoDB "
"binaries to 2.6. For sharded clusters, ensure that **all** cluster "
"components are 2.6. If there are users in any database, be sure you have at "
"least one user in the ``admin`` database with the role "

"Because downgrades are more difficult after you upgrade the user "
"authorization model, once you upgrade the MongoDB binaries to version 2.6, "
"allow your MongoDB deployment to run a day or two **without** upgrading the "
"user authorization model."

"This allows 2.6 some time to \"burn in\" and decreases the likelihood of "
"downgrades occurring after the user privilege model upgrade. The user "
"authentication and access control will continue to work as it did in 2.4, "
"**but** it will be impossible to create or modify users or to use user-"
"defined roles until you run the authorization upgrade."

"If you decide to upgrade the user authorization model immediately instead of"
" waiting the recommended \"burn in\" period, then for sharded clusters, you "
