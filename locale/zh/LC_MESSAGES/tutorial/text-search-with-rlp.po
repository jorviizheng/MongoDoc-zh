"In addition to the languages supported by text search in MongoDB, MongoDB "
"Enterprise provides support for the following additional languages: Arabic, "
"Farsi (specifically Dari and Iranian Persian dialects), Urdu, Simplified "
"Chinese, and Traditional Chinese."

"To provide support for these six additional languages, MongoDB Enterprise "

"To use MongoDB with RLP, MongoDB requires a license for the Base Linguistics"

"Support for any of the specified languages is conditional on having a valid "
"RLP license for the language. For instance, if there is only an RLP license "
"provided for Arabic, then MongoDB will only enable support for Arabic and "
"will not enable support for any other RLP based languages. For any language "
"which lacks a valid license, the MongoDB log will contain a warning message."

"debug messages that identify each supported language."
