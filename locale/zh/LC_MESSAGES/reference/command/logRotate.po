"The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is an administrative command that allows "
"you to rotate the MongoDB logs to prevent a single logfile from consuming "
"too much disk space."

"You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the "
":program:`mongod` process. If your :program:`mongod` has a process ID of "

"When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate` are set to "
"``rename``, :dbcommand:`logRotate` renames the existing log file by "
"appending the current timestamp to the filename. The appended timestamp has "
"the following form:"

msgid ""
"When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate` are set to "
"``reopen``, :dbcommand:`logRotate` follows the typical Linux/Unix behavior, "
"and simply closes the log file, and then reopens a log file with the same "
"name. With ``reopen``, :program:`mongod` expects that another process "
"renames the file prior to the rotation, and that the reopen results in the "
"creation of a new file."
