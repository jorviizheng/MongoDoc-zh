.. update:: $isolated

   Prevents a write operation that affects multiple documents from
   yielding to other reads or writes once the first document is
   written. By using the :update:`$isolated` option, you can ensure
   that no client sees the changes until the operation completes or
   errors out.

   This behavior can significantly affect the concurrency of the system
   as the operation holds the write lock much longer than normal for
   storage engines that take a write lock (e.g. MMAPv1), or for
   document-level locking storage engine that normally do not take a
   write lock (e.g. WiredTiger), :update:`$isolated` operator will make
   WiredTiger single-threaded for the duration of the operation.

Behavior
--------

The :update:`$isolated` isolation operator does **not** provide
"all-or-nothing" atomicity for write operations.

:update:`$isolated` does **not** work with :term:`sharded clusters <sharded
cluster>`.

Example
-------

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.foo.update(
       { status : "A" , $isolated : 1 },
       { $inc : { count : 1 } },
       { multi: true }
   )

Without the :update:`$isolated` operator, the ``multi``-update
operation will allow other operations to interleave with its update of
the matched documents.

.. seealso::
   :method:`db.collection.update()` and :method:`db.collection.remove()`

.. update:: $atomic

   .. deprecated:: 2.2
      The :update:`$isolated` operator replaces :operator:`$atomic`.
