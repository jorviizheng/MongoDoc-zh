db.collection.reIndex()
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. method:: db.collection.reIndex()

   The :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` drops all indexes on a
   collection and recreates them. This operation may be expensive for
   collections that have a large amount of data and/or a large number
   of indexes.

   Call this method, which takes no arguments, on a collection
   object. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.reIndex()

   Normally, MongoDB compacts indexes during routine updates. For most
   users, the :method:`db.collection.reIndex()` is unnecessary. However, it
   may be worth running if the collection size has changed significantly
   or if the indexes are consuming a disproportionate amount of disk space.
