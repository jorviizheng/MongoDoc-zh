HTTP Status Interface
---------------------

.. include:: /includes/warning-http-interface.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-deprecated-http-interface.rst

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

   The :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances run with the HTTP interface
   *disabled* by default. See :setting:`net.http.enabled` setting.

The HTTP status interface provides a web-based interface that includes a variety of
operational data, logs, and status reports regarding the :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` instance. The HTTP status interface is *disabled* by default and is not
recommended for production use.

The :setting:`net.http.enabled` setting enables HTTP status interface. When enabled
without the :setting:`net.http.RESTInterfaceEnabled` setting, the HTTP interface is
entirely read-only and limited in scope.

The HTTP interface uses the port that is ``1000`` greater than the primary
:program:`mongod` port. By default, the HTTP interface port is ``28017``, but is
indirectly set using the :setting:`net.port` option which allows you to configure the
primary :program:`mongod` port.

The HTTP status interface does not include support for authentication
other than ``MONGODB-CR``.

.. include:: /includes/fact-http-interface-scram.rst

.. warning:: 
   If you enable the interface, you should only allow trusted clients to access this
   port. See :ref:`security-firewalls`.

.. _rest-api:

REST API
--------

.. include:: /includes/warning-http-interface.rst

The REST API to MongoDB provides additional information and write
access on top of the HTTP status interface. While the REST API does not
provide any support for insert, update, or remove operations, it does
provide administrative access, and its accessibility represents a
vulnerability in a secure environment. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-deprecated-http-interface.rst

The REST interface is *disabled* by default and is not recommended for production use.

The :setting:`net.http.RESTInterfaceEnabled` setting for :program:`mongod` enables a
fully interactive administrative :term:`REST` interface, which is *disabled* by default.
Enabling the REST API enables the HTTP interface, even if the HTTP interface option is
disabled, and makes the HTTP interface fully interactive.

The REST API does not include support for authentication
other than ``MONGODB-CR``.

.. warning::
   If you enable the interface, you should only allow trusted clients to access this
   port. See :ref:`security-firewalls`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-http-interface-scram.rst

``bind_ip``
-----------

The :setting:`net.bindIp` setting (or the ``--bind_ip`` command line option) for
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances limits the network interfaces on which
MongoDB programs will listen for incoming connections.

.. warning::

   Make sure that your :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
   instances are only accessible on trusted networks. If your system
   has more than one network interface, bind MongoDB programs to the
   private or internal network interface.
