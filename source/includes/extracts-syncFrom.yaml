   Sync Logic
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   Only modify the default sync logic as needed, and always exercise
   caution. {{syncfrom}} will not affect an in-progress initial sync
   operation. To affect the sync target for the initial sync, run
   {{syncfrom}} operation *before* initial sync.

   If you run {{syncfrom}} during initial sync, MongoDB
   produces no error messages, but the sync target will not change until
   after the initial sync operation.

   Target
   ~~~~~~

   The member to sync from must be a valid source for data in the set.
   To sync from a member, the member must:

   - Have data. It cannot be an arbiter, in startup or recovering mode, and
     must be able to answer data queries.

   - Be accessible.

   - Be a member of the same set in the replica set configuration.

   - Build indexes with the
     :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` setting.

   - A different member of the set, to prevent syncing from itself.

   If you attempt to replicate from a member that is more than 10 seconds
   behind the current member, :program:`mongod` will log a warning but will
   still replicate from the lagging member.

   If you run {{syncfrom}} during initial sync, MongoDB produces no error
   messages, but the sync target will not change until after the initial
   sync operation.

   Persistence
   ~~~~~~~~~~~

   {{syncfrom}} provide a temporary override of default behavior.
   :program:`mongod` will revert to the default sync behavior in the
   following situations:

   - The :program:`mongod` instance restarts.

   - The connection between the :program:`mongod` and the sync target
     closes.

   - If the sync target falls more than 30 seconds behind another
     member of the replica set.
