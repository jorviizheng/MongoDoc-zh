   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-referencing>` to
   "parent" nodes in "child" nodes.

   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-referencing>` to
   "parent" nodes and an array that stores all ancestors.

file: /tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-materialized-paths
description: |
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing full relationship paths between documents. In
   addition to the tree node, each document stores the ``_id``
   of the nodes ancestors or path as a string.

description: |
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure using the *Nested Sets* pattern. This optimizes
   discovering subtrees at the expense of tree mutability.
