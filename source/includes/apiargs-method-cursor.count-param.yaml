  Specifies whether to consider the effects of the
  :method:`cursor.skip()` and :method:`cursor.limit()` methods in the
  count. By default, the :method:`~cursor.count()` method
  ignores the effects of the :method:`cursor.skip()` and
  :method:`cursor.limit()`. Set ``applySkipLimit`` to ``true`` to
  consider the effect of these methods.
